These files should all be in the same location as the .ino sketch and can be placed anywhere
data.h
EEPROMAnything.h
GPS_Cube.ino
mySoftwareSerial.cpp
mySoftwareSerial.h

Libraries PinChangeInt and TinyGPS should both be unzipped into the Downloads directory and then in the IDE do a Sketch/Import Library to import both libraries
